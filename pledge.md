The Pledge
I solemnly swear, that I will never place a private key or secret phrase or mnemonic in a .env file that is associated with real funds.

I will only place private keys in a .env file that have ONLY testnet ETH, LINK, or other cryptocurrencies.

When I'm testing and developing, I will use a different wallet than the one associated with my real funds.

I am aware that if I forget a .gitignore and push my key/phrase up to GitHub even for a split-second, or show my key/phrase to the internet for a split second, it should be considered compromised and I should move all my funds immediately.

If I am unsure if my account has real funds in it, I will assume it has real funds in it. If I assume it has real funds in it, I will not use it for developing purposes.

I am aware that even if I hit add account on my metamask (or other ETH wallet) I will get a new private key, but it will share the same secret phrase/mnemonic of the other accounts generated in that metamask (or other ETH wallet).

Pledge Additions
For this course, I will only use funds associated with a brand new never-before-used metamask (or other ETH wallet). I am aware that my account associated with my private key is the same on testnets that it is on mainnets.

If I must use a private key associated with real funds in the future, until I am 100% sure what I am doing I will always either:

Use the encryption methods Patrick showed (ideally)
Use some better encryption stuff Patrick didn't show
Use the command line way to pass private keys, and delete my command line history right after
If I never actually deploy anything to mainnet myself or work with a private key with real funds, I do not need to be concerned.

EDIT
Look at all you safe people! I'd like all your comments if I could, but love how you're all being safe!! Keep it up!
